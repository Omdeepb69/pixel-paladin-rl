# Pixel Paladin RL

## Description
Train an AI agent using Reinforcement Learning to master a custom-built Pygame environment, learning complex strategies beyond simple scripted behavior. It's dangerous to go alone; train this!

## Features
- Custom Pygame 2D environment (e.g., maze navigation, simple platformer, or top-down shooter).
- Implementation of a core Reinforcement Learning algorithm (like Q-Learning or basic DQN).
- Agent learns optimal policies through trial-and-error interaction with the game.
- Visualization of the agent's learning progress (e.g., rewards per episode).
- The agent exhibits emergent behaviors not explicitly programmed.

## Learning Benefits
Gain practical experience with Reinforcement Learning fundamentals, environment design in Pygame, agent-environment interaction loops, state-action-reward concepts, and debugging/tuning ML models for game AI. Understand the difference between scripted AI and learning-based AI.

## Technologies Used
- pygame
- numpy
- tensorflow | pytorch
- matplotlib (for plotting progress)
- gymnasium (optional, useful for standardizing the env interface)
